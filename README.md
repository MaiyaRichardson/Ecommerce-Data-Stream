# Ecommerce Data Stream
Our team will be creating a data producer that will generate real time data simulating orders from an E-Commerce application

# Technologies Used
* Scala
* Spark
* Kafka
* Spark.SQL
* VSCode
* GitHub
* AWS EC2
* Tableau


# Features
* Created a producer program that will ingest data to a Kafka Topic
* 5% of the data must be bad
* Data generation that is self-sustaining
* Ingested the data into the Kafka Topic at a minimum of every two seconds	
* Displayed the data from the input Kafka Topic in a console consumer (CLI)
* Created a consumer program in Spark that will read and clean the data stream from the input
* Display a visualization of all the above outputs using a data visualization tool (Tableau)


# Usage
* In Scala, our team wrote a method corresponding to each individual field of data. In these methods, we returned a randomly generated piece of data and joined them all together to create the random strings we used to populate kafka.
